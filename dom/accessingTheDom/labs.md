## Labs

1. Create an HTML file named `selecting.html` and a JavaScript file named `selecting.js`.

1. Write a well-formed HTML document in `selecting.html` and add an `<h1>` that says `Hello world`.  

1. Import your `selecting.js` file into your `selecting.html` file using `<script src='selecting.js'></script>`  

1. In your JS file, select the `<h1>` element, and use the `.textContent` property to change `Hello World` to `Hello (your name)`.  

1. Add an unordered list (`<ul>`) of 5 list items to the HTML (don't put any text between the `<li>`s).  

1. In `selecting.js` create a JavaScript array with five string values in it.  

1. Use a selector to access the unordered list's `li`s and store the collection into a variable.  

1. Iterate over the collection of `li`s. Use `textContent` to insert the values from your array into each of the list items.
